# Lung_cancer_detection
Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both lungs. These abnormal  cells do not carry out the functions of normal lung cells and do not develop into healthy lung  tissue. This one of the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. A copious number of researches  are going on worldwide regarding the detection of lung cancer easily by analyzing symptoms  primarily before going into many complex medical tasks. Implementation of various machine  learning algorithm in a medical criteria has been always a great help. In this paper, we have tried  to show how much accurately various predictive models can predict presence of lung cancer from  a given set of symptoms. Also, we have discussed a comparison between some classifiers which  has been used for our predictive modeling
